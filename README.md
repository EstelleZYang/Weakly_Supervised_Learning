+ Project summary: In this project, we will carry out model evaluation and selection for predictive analytics on an imbalanced image data. As data scientists, we often need to evaluate different modeling/analysis strategies and decide what is the best. Such decisions need to be supported by sound evidence in the form of model assessment, validation and comparison. In addition, we also need to communicate our decision and supporting evidence clearly and convincingly in an accessible fashion.

We will be dealing with a classification problem, where the training labels are not perfect. This is a common phenomenon in data science. Getting accurate ground true labels can be costly and time-consuming. Sometimes, it is even impossible. The weakly supervised learning is a subject that addresses the issue with imperfect labels. In particular, we are going to train a predictive model where label noises exist.
